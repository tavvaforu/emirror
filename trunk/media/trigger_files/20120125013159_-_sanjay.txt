 me:  Made note of it.Thank you
 sanjay.ja?garlamudi:  but defenetly it is not worth testing functional scenarios
 Sent at 11:37 AM on Monday
 me:  OH Ok. I think we wasted some time in testing functional scenarios in the past .

 sanjay.ja?garlamudi:  Configuration settings vary on the server and also if they are using any third party dlls that might have a different dll for 64bit. which you can find with one scenario instead of testing all scenarios
 me:  you mean in the web.comfig file
 sanjay.ja?garlamudi:  on the other side during load test.. you can find session limitation of 2 GB for 32bit

 me:  Regarding Configuration Settings are you referring to web.config file or in the IIS settings?
 sanjay.ja?garlamudi:  I'm referring to SQL server configuration
 me:  Ahh... Ok
 sanjay.ja?garlamudi:  or let the developers let you know what are the special settings they do on 64bit just as a starting point and expand the test cases in similar lines
say if they have to enable Named Pipes or TCP they have to do in two places on a 64bit
